## aRename Files in Folder in Sequence \(New\)


</div>

### Description

This is an update to my previous program which

renames all the Files in a Directory in sequence,

eg. if you have a Directory full of Files and you

want to rename them all the same but with a index number

on the end then this will do it. This new version can

increase and decrease the index number, rename the

extension only, with the option of having the Filename

UpperCase, LowerCase and Selectedcase, (SelectedCase

sets the first character to UppersCase and every character

it finds after a blank space, eg "this is a test.txt" would

become "This Is A Test.txt", you can now do this operation

on selected Files only. Very simple program but comes in

handy especially when renaming .gif files to make animated

gifs.
 
### More Info
 
Misc

Select an option from the top first, eg. Rename File or Extension only.

New Filename

Lots of swearing and a headache if you rename the wrong Files.
